PROBLEM STATEMENT
  A program is required that will simulate a simple fight against an A.I opponent with the user's input being specific actions (attack, block, grab) that will then decide how one round plays out. After 5 rounds, a "battle report" will be generated which lists each round, what each player did, and how their actions interacted.

Nouns: input actions, round, report

Verbs: simulate, decide, generate, interacted



DEFINING DIAGRAM

Inputs: userAction (5 times)

Processing: decide aiAction, add interaction to battleLog

Outputs: battleLog



SOLUTION ALGORITHM

UpdateFight(userAct, enemyAct)
  IF (attack,attack)
    add "you both dealt damage" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (attack,grab)
    add "you dealt damage" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (attack,block)
    add "they blocked your attack" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (grab,attack)
    add "they dealt damage to you" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (grab,grab)
    add "you grab eachother" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (grab,block)
    add "you grab them" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (block,attack)
    add "you block their attack" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (block,grab)
    add "they grab you" to report
  ENDIF
  IF (block,block)
    add "you both block" to report
  ENDIF
END

DecideAiAction()
  initialise random as random between 0 and 2
  SWITCH (random)
    case 0:
      return "attack"
    case 1:
      return "grab"
    case 2:
      return "block"
END

Main
  initialise userAction as ""
  initialise aiAction as ""
  initialise popUp as "Welcome to the fight!"
  initialise output as ""
  initialise report as ""

  FOR 5 times
    prompt for userAction with popUp + "<br>please enter attack, grab, or block"
    run UpdateFight with (userAction, DecideAiAction())
  ENDFOR

  add winner to report

  display report

END
